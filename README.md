# To-Do List

Simple to do list application being built to practice React concepts. Small additions will be made daily/weekly to review
older simpler topics studied, all the way to newer and more complex ones I need practice with. Using a to-do list is something I do everyday, so it serves that purpose for me as well while I continue to build it and solidify my react knowledge.

Commits (Things I'm adding for practice, and anything I add along with the code moving forward with each commit):
1. React + Component level state
2. Bootstrap styling with placeholder for adding time
3. Refactored code to work with redux, instead of component level state
4. Added reduxForm to handle adding tasks and time
5. Displays tasks created with proper formatted 12 Hour time
