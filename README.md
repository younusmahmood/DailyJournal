#To-Do List

Simple to do list application being built to practice React concepts. Small additions will be made daily to review
older simpler topics studied, all the way to new more complex ones I need practice with. Using a to-do list is something
I do everyday, so it serves that purpose for me as well while I continue to build it and solidify my react knowledge.

Commits (Things I'm adding for practice, and anything I add along with the code moving forward):
1. React + Component level state
